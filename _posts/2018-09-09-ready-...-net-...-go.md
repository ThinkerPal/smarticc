As technology advances, there are now more and more Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered devices. Some examples are self-driving cars, smart home and mobile phones. However, effective delivery of the data that AI needs, you need speedy access to loads of information, namely, the internet. While in the past, you need fiber optics for that kind of network speed, a new kind of technology brings wireless network at this speed. This is 5G.

The benefits and economic values of 5G network is obvious. Not only do telco providers like SingTel and M1 want to gain more customers by selling faster network plans, giant technology companies like Samsung and Apple also want to put it into their next-gen smartphones. Consumers also want the fastest speed possible for their use. There is no wonder why countries like the USA and China want to develop the technology as soon as possible.

Many new technologies are required to enable this.

By using new radio frequencies, data can be transferred at greater speed.

By taking in multiple inputs and multiple outputs, the data transfer occurs simultaneously so that more data can be transferred and received per unit time.

By using smaller and more network towers, coverage can be increased so that data transfer speed is consistent over wide areas.

Finally, by sending signals at directions rather than radially, data transfer takes place more efficiently.
